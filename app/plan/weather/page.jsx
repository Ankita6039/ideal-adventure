                <p class="mb-3 text-justify font-serif text-black-500  dark:text-black-400">The best time to visit Rajasthan will mostly depend on what you plan to do when you visit the state. While the summers are rather hot in Rajasthan, they may not be the best time to visit Rajasthan, as the temperatures may severely impact your sightseeing schedules, winters are generally considered to be the best season to visit Rajasthan. However, it all depends on what you plan to do and how much you can stand the heat. Some knowledge about what the temperature and weather is like during the year can help you in better planning your itinerary.</p>
                <p class="mb-3  font-bold text-justify font-serif text-black-500  dark:text-black-400">Rajasthan during the different times of the year</p>
                <p class="mb-3  text-justify font-serif text-black-500  dark:text-black-400">Given its location and geography, the state of Rajasthan mainly experiences three seasons, those being - winters, monsoon, and  summer.</p>
                <p class="mb-3  text-justify font-serif text-black-500  dark:text-black-400"><span className="font-bold">Winters – </span>The winters are marked as being the best season to visit Rajasthan. While various parts of India experience an extreme drop in temperatures and chilly weather, the princely state enjoys a mild weather with temperatures ranging between 10°C – 30°C for most parts. Winters in Rajasthan usually commence around October and extend to January.
                 While it is nice and sunny during the day, it is mostly the nights that get chilly during this time of the year.
                 <br/><br/>
                 Another significant reason that makes winters the best time to visit Rajasthan is the series of colourful and exciting fairs and festivals that take place in various cities. Some of the most popular festivals that the state is known for, including the Jaipur Literature Festival, Udaipur World Music Festival, Camel Fair, and Pushkar Fair, are observed during the winter season.

So, visiting Rajasthan during the winters will enable you to witness the culture of Rajasthan a little closely.
<br/> <br/>
<span className="font-bold">Monsoons– </span> The South-West Monsoon and Western Disturbances are the main causes of rainfall in Rajasthan. The Aravalli range running across Rajasthan from Guru Shikhar in the south west to Khetri in the north east, divides the state in a 60 by 40 ratio. So, while 60% of the state lies to the north west of the range, 40% of it lies to the south east. Lying parallel to the incoming southwest monsoon winds, the mountain range fails to intercept them, resulting in a dry and sandy north west region. On the contrary, the eastern and south eastern parts of Rajasthan are both better watered and more fertile. Rainfall in Rajasthan ranges in between 100-165 mm during the monsoon season. The presence of impervious rocks in the western parts of Rajasthan can also sometimes cause them to flood up.
<br/> <br/>
Visiting Rajasthan during the monsoon season, you will be welcomed by lush greenery, rainbows, and peacocks dancing around. You will also get to catch up on some cultural extravaganzas, as various parts of the state ready up for the Teej festival in the monsoon season.
              <br /> <br />
              <span className="font-bold">Summers– </span> Summers in Rajasthan are usually hot and dry, with temperatures rising up to as high as 48 degrees Celsius. Scorching heat and high temperatures make things challenging for people here. Temperatures in areas around the Thar Desert are usually the harshest. However, summers in places like Mount Abu, Ranakpur, and Kumbhalgarh in Rajasthan, which are the places to which tourists mostly flock to when visiting the state in this season, are rather pleasant.
For people who have a problem with extreme weather conditions, this might not be the best time to visit Rajasthan. However, if you plan on coming to Rajasthan during this time of the year, make sure that you bring along things like sunscreen and comfortable and light cotton clothes with you. It will also help save you from sunburns if these attires are full-sleeved.
